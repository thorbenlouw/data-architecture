# Realises

- [AI agents](../../capabilities/generative-ai/ai-agents.md) (Generative AI) (primary): Build systems in which models plan, call tools and act over several steps to complete a task.
- [Agent tool and data access](../../capabilities/generative-ai/agent-tool-access.md) (Generative AI): Give agents governed access to data and actions through tools and protocols such as MCP.
- [AI gateway](../../capabilities/generative-ai/ai-gateway.md) (Generative AI): Route, secure, rate-limit and track model calls across providers from one place.
- [Agent hosting and runtime](../../capabilities/generative-ai/agent-runtime.md) (Generative AI): Deploy and run agents as managed services with identity, durable state, scaling and sandboxed code execution.
- [Agent and tool registry](../../capabilities/generative-ai/agent-registry.md) (Generative AI): Keep a governed inventory of agents, tools and MCP servers with owners and permissions so they can be found, approved and controlled.
- [AI usage and spend controls](../../capabilities/platform-operations/ai-spend-controls.md) (Platform operations): Limit, prioritise and attribute model and agent consumption per user, team or application.
