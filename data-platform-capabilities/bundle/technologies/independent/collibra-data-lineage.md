# Realises

- [End-to-end lineage](../../capabilities/metadata/cross-system-lineage.md) (Metadata and discovery) (primary): Stitch lineage across ingestion tools, platforms and BI tools into one connected view.
- [Column-level lineage](../../capabilities/metadata/column-lineage.md) (Metadata and discovery): Track how each column is derived from source columns.
- [Table-level lineage](../../capabilities/metadata/table-lineage.md) (Metadata and discovery): Track dependencies between datasets, tables and views.
- [Impact analysis](../../capabilities/metadata/impact-analysis.md) (Metadata and discovery): Use lineage to find everything affected by a proposed change or a data incident.
