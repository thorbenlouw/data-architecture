# Realises

- [Change data capture](../../capabilities/ingestion-integration/change-data-capture.md) (Ingestion and integration) (primary): Capture inserts, updates and deletes from source databases, usually from transaction logs, and apply them downstream with low latency.
- [Streaming SQL](../../capabilities/processing/streaming-sql.md) (Processing and transformation): Express continuous transformations and incrementally maintained views over streams in SQL.
- [Database replication and mirroring](../../capabilities/ingestion-integration/database-replication.md) (Ingestion and integration): Replicate operational databases continuously into the analytical platform without building pipelines.
- [Streaming ingestion](../../capabilities/ingestion-integration/streaming-ingestion.md) (Ingestion and integration): Load continuous event streams from brokers, applications or devices into the platform with seconds-level latency.
