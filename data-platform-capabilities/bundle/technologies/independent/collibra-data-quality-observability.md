Checks can be pushed down to the warehouse's own compute or run on a dedicated Spark engine. Rules can be generated from data contracts and policies through the Collibra MCP server. Remediation tickets can go to Jira or ServiceNow.

# Realises

- [Data quality rules](../../capabilities/data-quality/data-quality-rules.md) (Data quality and observability) (primary): Define and run checks that data must pass, such as completeness, validity, uniqueness and consistency.
- [Data observability](../../capabilities/data-quality/data-observability.md) (Data quality and observability): Monitor data in production for freshness, volume, schema and distribution problems, and alert owners.
- [Data anomaly detection](../../capabilities/data-quality/data-anomaly-detection.md) (Data quality and observability): Learn normal patterns in data and alert on unexpected changes without hand-written rules.
- [Data profiling](../../capabilities/data-quality/data-profiling.md) (Data quality and observability): Analyse data to understand its structure, distributions, completeness and anomalies.
- [Data quality scorecards](../../capabilities/data-quality/data-quality-scorecards.md) (Data quality and observability): Track quality results over time and report them by dataset, domain and quality dimension.
