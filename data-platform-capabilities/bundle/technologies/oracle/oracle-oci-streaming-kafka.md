# Realises

- [Event streaming](../../capabilities/ingestion-integration/event-streaming.md) (Ingestion and integration) (primary): Publish and subscribe to durable, ordered and replayable streams of events between systems.
- [Streaming ingestion](../../capabilities/ingestion-integration/streaming-ingestion.md) (Ingestion and integration): Load continuous event streams from brokers, applications or devices into the platform with seconds-level latency.

**Platform:** [Oracle](../../platforms/platform-oracle.md)
