# Realises

- [Hybrid and multi-cloud deployment](../../capabilities/platform-operations/deployment-options.md) (Platform operations) (primary): Run the platform across clouds, regions or on-premises, or inside your own cloud account.
- [Operational database integration](../../capabilities/serving/operational-database.md) (Serving and activation): Run transactional databases as part of the platform, with data flowing to and from analytical storage without separate pipelines.
- [Network security](../../capabilities/security/network-security.md) (Security and access): Keep data traffic on private networks and restrict where the platform can be reached from.
