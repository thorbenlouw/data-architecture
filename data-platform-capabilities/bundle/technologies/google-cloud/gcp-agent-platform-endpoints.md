Request-response logging writes prediction inputs and outputs to BigQuery. Private Service Connect endpoints keep traffic private.

# Realises

- [Real-time inference](../../capabilities/mlops/real-time-inference.md) (ML operations) (primary): Serve predictions through low-latency endpoints.
- [Batch inference](../../capabilities/mlops/batch-inference.md) (ML operations): Score large datasets with a model on a schedule.
- [Canary and A/B testing](../../capabilities/mlops/canary-ab-testing.md) (ML operations): Route a share of live traffic to a new model and compare outcomes before full rollout.
- [Inference logging](../../capabilities/mlops/inference-logging.md) (ML operations): Capture model inputs, outputs and metadata for monitoring, audit and retraining.
