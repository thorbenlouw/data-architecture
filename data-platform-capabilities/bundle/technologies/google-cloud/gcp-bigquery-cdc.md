Rows carry _CHANGE_TYPE (UPSERT or DELETE) and optional _CHANGE_SEQUENCE_NUMBER; max_staleness trades freshness against apply cost. DML, search indexes and some copy/clone operations are restricted on active CDC tables. Datastream uses this path when it writes to BigQuery.

# Realises

- [Change data capture](../../capabilities/ingestion-integration/change-data-capture.md) (Ingestion and integration) (primary): Capture inserts, updates and deletes from source databases, usually from transaction logs, and apply them downstream with low latency.
- [Row-level updates and deletes](../../capabilities/storage/row-level-updates.md) (Storage and table management): Update, delete and merge individual rows in large tables efficiently.

**Platform:** [Google Cloud](../../platforms/platform-google-cloud.md)
