MSK Connect runs Kafka Connect connectors such as Debezium; MSK Replicator copies topics between clusters in the same or another Region. Express brokers trade some configuration control for faster scaling and recovery.

# Realises

- [Event streaming](../../capabilities/ingestion-integration/event-streaming.md) (Ingestion and integration) (primary): Publish and subscribe to durable, ordered and replayable streams of events between systems.
- [Cross-region replication and failover](../../capabilities/platform-operations/cross-region-failover.md) (Platform operations): Replicate data and configuration to another region and fail over when needed.
- [Custom connector development](../../capabilities/ingestion-integration/custom-connectors.md) (Ingestion and integration): Build and run connectors for sources with no prebuilt option, using an SDK or framework.
