Runs Spark 3.5 with Spark UI and Lake Formation table-level access control (November 2025 update). It is the default runtime for SageMaker Unified Studio notebooks but does not support VPC connectivity, so EMR Serverless or Glue is needed for private sources.

# Realises

- [Distributed processing](../../capabilities/processing/distributed-processing.md) (Processing and transformation) (primary): Process large datasets in parallel across a cluster of machines.
- [Serverless compute](../../capabilities/compute/serverless-compute.md) (Query and compute): Run workloads without managing servers, with capacity allocated on demand and billed by use.
- [Notebooks](../../capabilities/development-lifecycle/notebooks.md) (Development and DataOps): Develop interactively with code, results and narrative together, with collaboration and scheduling.
- [DataFrame APIs](../../capabilities/processing/dataframe-apis.md) (Processing and transformation): Express transformations in Python, Scala or other languages through DataFrame interfaces that run in the engine.
