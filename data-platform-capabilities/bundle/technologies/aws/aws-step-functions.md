Direct integrations cover Glue, EMR, Athena, Redshift Data API, SageMaker AI, Bedrock and, since 2026, AgentCore harness. Distributed Map processes large S3 object sets in parallel. Often used instead of Airflow for AWS-only pipelines.

# Realises

- [Workflow orchestration](../../capabilities/orchestration/workflow-orchestration.md) (Orchestration) (primary): Define pipelines as dependency graphs of tasks and run them on schedules with retries and alerts.
- [Application integration](../../capabilities/ingestion-integration/application-integration.md) (Ingestion and integration): Connect applications through APIs, events and process flows in near real time, outside the analytical data path.
- [Event-driven triggering](../../capabilities/orchestration/event-driven-triggering.md) (Orchestration): Start pipelines when something happens, such as a file arriving, a table changing or a message being published.
