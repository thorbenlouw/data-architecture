Version 4.0, on the high-performance Snowpipe Streaming architecture, became GA in April 2026. The Openflow Kafka connector is the managed alternative to running Kafka Connect yourself.

# Realises

- [Streaming ingestion](../../capabilities/ingestion-integration/streaming-ingestion.md) (Ingestion and integration) (primary): Load continuous event streams from brokers, applications or devices into the platform with seconds-level latency.
- [Deduplication and idempotent loading](../../capabilities/ingestion-integration/idempotent-loading.md) (Ingestion and integration): Make loads safe to retry or replay by removing duplicates on write so nothing is counted twice.
