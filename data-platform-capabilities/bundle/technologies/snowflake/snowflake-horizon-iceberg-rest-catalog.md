title: Snowflake Horizon Iceberg REST Catalog API
description: An Apache Polaris-based Iceberg REST catalogue endpoint in each account that lets Spark, Trino, Flink, DuckDB, PyIceberg and other engines read and write Snowflake-managed Iceberg tables under Snowflake RBAC.

Based on [Apache Polaris](../open-source/apache-polaris.md) and supports vended credentials. Snowflake set billing per million API calls to start in the second half of 2026. Serving externally managed tables from [catalog-linked databases](snowflake-catalog-linked-databases.md) through the same endpoint, and the Iceberg Scan Plan API, are in preview. Tables with data protection policies are not served on the direct file path.

# Realises

- [Multi-engine interoperability](../../capabilities/compute/engine-interoperability.md) (Query and compute) (primary): Let several engines read and write the same tables through open formats and shared catalogues.
- [Metadata interoperability](../../capabilities/metadata/metadata-interoperability.md) (Metadata and discovery): Exchange metadata between tools through open APIs and standards.
- [Storage credential vending](../../capabilities/storage/credential-vending.md) (Storage and table management): Have the catalogue issue short-lived, table-scoped storage credentials to engines so they never hold broad storage access.
