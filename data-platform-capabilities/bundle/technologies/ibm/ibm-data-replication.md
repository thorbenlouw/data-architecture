The replication engine behind watsonx.data integration's data replication capability; strong for mainframe sources.

# Realises

- [Change data capture](../../capabilities/ingestion-integration/change-data-capture.md) (Ingestion and integration) (primary): Capture inserts, updates and deletes from source databases, usually from transaction logs, and apply them downstream with low latency.
- [Database replication and mirroring](../../capabilities/ingestion-integration/database-replication.md) (Ingestion and integration): Replicate operational databases continuously into the analytical platform without building pipelines.
- [Mainframe data integration](../../capabilities/ingestion-integration/mainframe-integration.md) (Ingestion and integration): Capture and offload data from mainframe databases and files with minimal load on the host.
