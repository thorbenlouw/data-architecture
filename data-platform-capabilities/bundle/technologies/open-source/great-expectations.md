# Realises

- [Data quality rules](../../capabilities/data-quality/data-quality-rules.md) (Data quality and observability) (primary): Define and run checks that data must pass, such as completeness, validity, uniqueness and consistency.
- [Data profiling](../../capabilities/data-quality/data-profiling.md) (Data quality and observability): Analyse data to understand its structure, distributions, completeness and anomalies.
- [Data pipeline testing](../../capabilities/development-lifecycle/data-testing.md) (Development and DataOps): Test transformation logic and data with unit, integration and regression tests before release.
