MPL 2.0, under the Linux Foundation and a CNCF sandbox project since April 2025; current release 1.13. Forked from Terraform 1.5 after HashiCorp's licence change. Largely compatible with Terraform providers, including those for Databricks, Snowflake and the clouds; adds features such as state encryption.

# Realises

- [Infrastructure as code](../../capabilities/platform-operations/infrastructure-as-code.md) (Platform operations) (primary): Define platform resources, permissions and configuration as code and apply them automatically.
- [Self-service provisioning](../../capabilities/platform-operations/self-service-provisioning.md) (Platform operations): Let teams create approved workspaces, pipelines and resources from templates without waiting for a central team.

**Platform:** [Open-source ecosystem](../../platforms/platform-open-source.md)
