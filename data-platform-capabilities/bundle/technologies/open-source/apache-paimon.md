ASF top-level project, Apache 2.0, driven mainly by Alibaba. Best suited to streaming lakehouses fed by Flink CDC. Can expose Iceberg-compatible metadata for other readers.

# Realises

- [Open table formats](../../capabilities/storage/open-table-formats.md) (Storage and table management) (primary): Manage collections of files as transactional tables with a defined schema, history and metadata.
- [Row-level updates and deletes](../../capabilities/storage/row-level-updates.md) (Storage and table management): Update, delete and merge individual rows in large tables efficiently.
- [Change feeds](../../capabilities/serving/change-feeds.md) (Serving and activation): Expose row-level changes to tables as a stream that downstream consumers can process incrementally.
- [Streaming ingestion](../../capabilities/ingestion-integration/streaming-ingestion.md) (Ingestion and integration): Load continuous event streams from brokers, applications or devices into the platform with seconds-level latency.
- [Table format conversion](../../capabilities/storage/table-format-conversion.md) (Storage and table management): Expose one copy of table data in several table formats by generating or translating metadata.
- [Deduplication and idempotent loading](../../capabilities/ingestion-integration/idempotent-loading.md) (Ingestion and integration): Make loads safe to retry or replay by removing duplicates on write so nothing is counted twice.
