Sources include Azure SQL Database and Managed Instance, SQL Server, Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Database for PostgreSQL, Oracle, SAP, Snowflake and Google BigQuery; MySQL, SharePoint lists and others are in preview. Replica storage is free up to 1 TB per capacity unit. Replaces Synapse Link for Cosmos DB and Dataverse.

# Realises

- [Database replication and mirroring](../../capabilities/ingestion-integration/database-replication.md) (Ingestion and integration) (primary): Replicate operational databases continuously into the analytical platform without building pipelines.
- [Change data capture](../../capabilities/ingestion-integration/change-data-capture.md) (Ingestion and integration): Capture inserts, updates and deletes from source databases, usually from transaction logs, and apply them downstream with low latency.
