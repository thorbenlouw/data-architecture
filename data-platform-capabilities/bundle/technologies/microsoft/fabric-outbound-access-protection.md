# Realises

- [Network security](../../capabilities/security/network-security.md) (Security and access) (primary): Keep data traffic on private networks and restrict where the platform can be reached from.
- [Data loss prevention](../../capabilities/security/data-loss-prevention.md) (Security and access): Detect and block sensitive data leaving approved boundaries.

**Platform:** [Microsoft Azure and Fabric](../../platforms/platform-microsoft.md)
